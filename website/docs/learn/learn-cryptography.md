This is a high-level overview of the cryptography used in Point Network. It assumes that you have some
knowledge about cryptographic primitives that are generally used in blockchains such as hashes,
elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), and public-private keypairs.

For detailed descriptions on the cryptography used in Point Network please see the more advanced
[research wiki](https://research.web3.foundation).
