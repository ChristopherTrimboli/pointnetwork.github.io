This is a high-level overview of the cryptography used in Point Network. It assumes that you have some
knowledge about cryptographic primitives that are generally used in blockchains such as hashes,
elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), and public-private keypairs.

## Hashing Algorithm

The hashing algorithm used in Point Network is [Keccak256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3). `Keccak256` is considered to be a very fast cryptographic hash function that is also used in the Ethereum EVM.
