### Run a Point Network Node in a VS Code Debugger

To debug the Point Network node in VS code:

In your local pointnetowrk node folder, generate compiled typescript sourcemap files by running:

```
npm run build -- --sourcemap
```

This will create a `dist` directory including `*.js.map` files which are used by the VS Code debugger.

1. Open VS Code
1. Open the Debugger tool
1. Click `create a launch.json` file (located under the blue "Run and Debug" button)
1. Select 'Node JS' from the environment drop down
1. In the `configurations` section of the `launch.json` file add `"outputCapture": "std"`
1. Click the 'Play' icon next to 'Launch Program' dropdown on the top left
1. Open a 'Debug Console' tab in VS Code and you will see the running Point Node logs
1. Add a breakpoint to any part of the Point Node JS code (perhaps in the `abort404` function of `ZProxy` class)
1. Open the Point Browser and navigate to a url that does not exist so that the breakpoint in the `abort404` function will be hit.
1. Now you can inspect the variables in VS Code and use the debugger as usual.
1. Continue to add breakpoints where you need to assist with your debugging!

### Sample launch.json file

Below is a sample `launch.json` file that you can use. Its the same as the one generated by VS code with the `outputCaputure` key added:

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "pwa-node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/point",
            "outputCapture": "std"
        }
    ]
}
```
